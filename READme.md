This is the firmware for the PID controller. It's still in development, but it's stable and functions well. It's a good example of the power of the PIC18F4620, and makes use of the GPIOs, PWM, ADC, timers, interrupts, UART, and I2C bus.

For now only the source code is up. Circuit schematics, PCB layout, and user manual to follow.
